# FermionED

This repository contains a .jl file, FermionED.jl, with a few functions for constructing numerical many-fermion Hamiltonians in the Julia programming language.

The "exact diagonalization" (ED) method is a non-perturbative numerical method for studying quantum many-body systems. Quite simply, one constructs and (partially) diagonalizes a matrix representation of a many-body Hamiltonian. Physical properties can be inferred from the many-body spectrum and eigenstates. The method relies on the presence of a finite-dimensional many-body Hilbert space. On a lattice system (e.g. one-band Hubbard model) this comes for free on a finite-size system. In a continuum system, the full many-body Hilbert space is infinite dimensional even on a finite-size system. In this case, the method typically involves projection onto the Fock space defined by a set of single-particle states that are energetically isolated (e.g. a Bloch band or Landau level) and is therefore variational, rather than "exact". In condensed mattter physics, this method has historically found great use in the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect in partially-filled Landau levels and, more recently, the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in partially-filled Chern bands. ED is closely related to the "Full Configuration Interaction" method of quantum chemistry.

This code is far from a self-contained software package. However, I hope that others may utilize my functions as building blocks or inspiration in developing their own exact diagonalization codes.

The code first constructs a many-body Fock space from a given set of single-particle states. Particle number, spin, and center-of-mass momentum conservation are exploited as relevant. Each single particle state is assigned an integer index "i" valued between 1 and (total number of single-particle states). Each Fock state $\ket{I}$ is assigned an integer $I = \sum_{i \in occ} 2^i$ where "occ" is a set of occupied single particle states. The $i^{th}$ entry (0-indexed, from right to left) of the bit string corresponding to the integer $I$ is 1 if $i \in occ$ and 0 if not. (One could also 0-index the single-particle states, which is perhaps the more natural choice. Here, due to chance rather than design, the single-particle states are 1-indexed.) For spinful systems with $N$ single particle states per spin, spin-up states are given the indices 1 through N and spin-down states are given the indices (N+1) through 2N. All manipulations use the functions "C" and "CDag" which implement second quantization entirely through arithmetic operations on the integers $I$. This methods allows for efficient, low-memory-footprint construction of the many-body Hamiltonian and calculation of observables.


The functions provided here only handle one-body and two-body terms. Explicitly, the functions are designed to handle Hamiltonians of the form
$H = T + V$ where $T = \sum_{ij,s_i s_j} t_{is_i,js_j} c_{i,s_i}^{\dagger} c_{j,s_j}$ is a ony-body term and $V = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijkl,s_js_js_ks_l} V_{is_i,js_j,ks_k,ls_l} c_{i,s_i}^{\dagger} c_{j,s_j}^{\dagger} c_{k,s_k} c_{l,s_l}$ is a two-body term. The matrix elements $t_{is_i,js_j}$ and $V_{is_i,js_j,ks_k,ls_l}$ must be calculated independently for the physical Hamiltonian at hand. The functions "C" and "CDag" functions could be straightforwardly used to handle n-body terms.

The functions contained here build a many-body Hamiltonian in the SparseMatrixCSC format from the SparseArrays.jl package. This sparse matrix can be partially diagonalized using other packages such as KrylovKit.jl ( "eigsolve" function) or Arpack.jl ("eigs" function), or converted to a dense matrix and fully diagonalized using LinearAlgebra.jl ("eigen" function).

I originally developed this code for the calculations published in Ref. [1] and have used it in several subsequent works [2-6]. I provide further discussion of the exact diagonalization method as applied to moir√© superlattice systems in the Supplementary Material of Ref. [1]. In developing this code, I greatly benefitted from Ref. [7]. I gratefully acknowledge helpful conversations with Trithep Devakul, Yang Zhang, Di Luo, and Donna Sheng. Finally, I thank Liang Fu for advising the research projects for which I developed and used this code.
